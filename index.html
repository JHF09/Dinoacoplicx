        so the story is like this. i actually got this story while dreaming so this might not make much sence but whatever. it was as if the end of the entire world. with wars everywhere. during that time a child discovered some wierd creatures. she took care of them but turns out they were litteler dinosaurs. after 90 years the earth was filled with dinasaurs and the boy who was deaeply loved by the dinasaurs was dying age but he still lived on. after he entered the age of 125 he was surely die this time. the earth was filled with dinasaurs the boy took care of for the last 115 years.
        on this side it seems like the place where the boy took care of the first dinasaurs it became a park to see the dinasaurs. everyone likes to pet those but sometimes people came to hunt those dinasaurs to research them but many public protests made it sure those dinasaurs won't get hurt. the court made the man a personal right to hold those dinasaurs. after the man died the dinasaurs were furious.
        but yet he didn't recieved a proper burial cause some scientists decided to get those without the truble of law this time with the help of corruption to get permission. this caused the dinasaurs to go on a rampage. thousands of dinasaur got into a rampage over the earth.
        but during the day it'll happend there was another boy present in that moment. he was 11. his name was grey or that's what'll i call him for now. he was surprised by the sudden rampage and decided to flee for his life by a randome car which contained an adult who drives it, some other people and a girl named stephine. there was another two boys named ali and arvin.
        they decided to leave the city cause of the situation and ali decided to leave the car mid way cause he wants to stay at home.
        <br>
        <br>
         nothing majour will happen if he's in his building. the car leaves without ali and seems like during their escape of the city a few dinasaurs like creature attacked them and the car is distroyed so they need to walk.
        they reached the border of the country to go to india and some were tresspassing into india and even the guards were helping them so they won't die but grey decided not to leave. he wants to go back. if alone then so be it cause he doesn't wants to go to another country fearing his life. he wants to go back home. those people didn't wanted to leave grey alone so they tried using force but grey fleed and stephine decided to go after him. 
        grey could have died by the hands of dinasaurs in the way but stephine and arvin who came back helped him back. arvin didn't wanted to go to a another country with some strangers and stephine liked grey's idea to go back so they both decided to go to a different city insted of leaving the country. then they can slowly return home when the entire thing is stopped.
        as they journey they came across some danger levels causing them to be trapped. they either can go back to home or they can die trying to reach a different city so those three decided to go back home cause if they need to die they'll die at their home. or that's the best.
        while walking they were covered by a wierd situation of dinasaurs again but while taking shelter during night they discovered some dinasaur eggs that they decided to look after and then they hatched. giving birth to absulute adorable creatures that grey couldn't help but be fond off. he took care of the dinasaurs for a while and then when the time came they were found by other dinasaurs so they left the place and entered their home town. grey returned to his home finding out his entire family is dead. ali is dead. the city is in ruins. grey now regrets coming back but he decided to go to arvin and stephine's place to make sure they are at least alive. then after a long journey grey finds that arvin is alive but stephine is injured. arvin carried her with him and they both decieded to split up causing the dinasaurs to hunt grey. grey was at the verge of death when he accepted his fate when the baby dinasaur appeard whom grey helped to hatch from an egg. the dinasaurs realized grey had the same heart as their original owner. it was as if he was reborn right after dying.
        so they took grey as their new king. After years. the dinasaurs grew fond of grey again but the govt wanted suretiy to not happend such event again and grey said if they don't interfear with their hapiness this short of event won't happen. grey married stephine and after that when his own son was born he taught him to take care of it. he'll make a secure generation by passing down the job creating a nice balance.
